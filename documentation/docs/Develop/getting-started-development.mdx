# Getting Started (Development)

OWASP dep-scan is under very active development by AppThreat and the OWASP community.
This is a comprehensive guide to contributing for developers of all experience level.

## Setting up the Development Environment
Here are steps to download and run dep-scan software.

:::note
dep-scan utilizes the `Cyclonedx/cdxgen` project. Therefore is it required to install it using
```bash
npm install -g @cyclonedx/cdxgen
```
You would have to download any package managers utilized by your project on your system in order to ensure that cdxgen works on them properly.

:::tip
While using cdxgen it is a good idea to `export CDXGEN_DEBUG_MODE=debug` to ensure if you can install and package managers you might be missing for a scan.
:::


1. Clone `owasp-dep-scan/dep-scan` project repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owasp-dep-scan/dep-scan
cd dep-scan
```

2. Setup uv by following the official [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```shell
uv sync --all-extras --dev
uv run depscan --help
uv run pytest
```

## Local VDB setup

```shell
vdb --clean
vdb --download-image
# To scan containers and OS images
# vdb --download-full-image
```

## Scan local depscan

```shell
uv run depscan --config .config/depscan-dev.toml
```

This would automatically use the configuration specified in the local config file.
