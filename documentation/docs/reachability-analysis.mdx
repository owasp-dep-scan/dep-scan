# Reachability Analysis

depscan can perform reachability analysis for Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python with built-in support for parsing [atom](https://github.com/AppThreat/atom) reachables slices. Simply invoke depscan with the `research` profile and language type to enable this feature.

To receive a verbose output including the reachable flows, pass the argument `--explain`

```shell
--profile research -t language [--explain]
```

## Example analysis for a Java project

```shell
depscan --profile research -t java -i <source directory> --reports-dir <reports directory> --explain
```

## Example analysis for a JavaScript project

```shell
depscan --profile research -t js -i <source directory> --reports-dir <reports directory> --explain
```

## Example analysis for a PHP project

Ensure PHP > 7.4 is installed. However, we support scanning PHP 5.2 - 8.3. Alternatively, use the depscan container image.

```shell
depscan --profile research -t php -i <source directory> --reports-dir <reports directory> --explain
```

## Customize the Reachability Analyzer

depscan supports two different reachability analyzers with `FrameworkReachability` being the default:

- **FrameworkReachability**: The Framework-Forward Reachability (FFR) algorithm computes reachability by identifying sources or entry points originating from framework-provided inputs or routes that reach a library sink.
- **SemanticReachability**: The Semantic Reachability algorithm builds on Framework-Forward Reachability by incorporating endpoint and service information to better prioritize vulnerabilities.

Pass the argument `--reachability-analyzer SemanticReachability` to use the Semantic Reachability analyzer.
