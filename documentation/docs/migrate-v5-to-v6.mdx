# Migrate from depscan v5 to v6

Use this document as a reference to migrate your depscan v5 workflows to v6.

## CLI arguments (BREAKING)

- `-o` is now an alias for `--reports-dir`. This is the output directory to store the reports.
- All `threatdb` related arguments and submit bom functionality are removed.
- `--cache`, `--sync`, `--no-error`, `--no-license-scan` arguments are removed.
- `--bom-engine` defaults to `auto`. In environments where the `docker` command is available, depscan automatically chooses a container-image–based SBOM generation. Pass `--bom-engine CdxgenGenerator` to force depscan to use the local cdxgen CLI.

## Packages/Dependencies changes

- `quart` package is an optional dependency in v6. To use the server mode, do `pip install owasp-depscan[all]`.
- `oras` is an indirect dependency via `appthreat-vulnerability-db`.

## Build and packaging

dep-scan repo uses `uv` for building and packaging.
