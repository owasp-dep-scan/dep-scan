# Customization through environment variables

The following environment variables can be used to customize the behavior.

-   VDB_HOME - Directory to use for caching database. For docker-based execution, this directory should get mounted as a volume from the host
-   VDB_DATABASE_URL - Vulnerability DB URL. Defaults to: ghcr.io/appthreat/vdbxz:v6, which includes both app and OS vulnerabilities. For a smaller app-only database, use `ghcr.io/appthreat/vdbxz-app:v6`
-   USE_VDB_10Y - Set to true to use the larger 10-year vulnerability database with both app and OS vulnerabilities. Default download url: ghcr.io/appthreat/vdbxz-10y:v6. For an app-only 10 year database use `ghcr.io/appthreat/vdbxz-app-10y:v6`
-   VDB_AGE_HOURS - Set the age threshold for the vulnerability database before it is re-downloaded. The default is 24 hours.
