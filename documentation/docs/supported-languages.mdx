dep-scan uses [cdxgen](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen) command internally to create a Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) file for the project. This is then used for performing the scans. Refer to the official cdxgen [documentation](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen/blob/master/docs/PROJECT_TYPES.md) for the list of supported project types.
